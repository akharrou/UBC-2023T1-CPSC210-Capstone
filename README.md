## About

1. **What will the application do?**

    have met your budget, or are over it (and how much you need to reduce).*

1. **Who will use it?**

    *Me, students, and people on tight budgets.*

1. **Why is this project of interest to you?**

    *Because on a tight budget, must make sure I don't go broke and starve.*
